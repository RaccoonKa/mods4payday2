1. Transfer the file "WSOCK32.dll" to the root folder of the game. The path can be like this: D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2.
2. Start the game, you will see a message, click "Yes" and wait for the download to finish. The game should close after that.
3. After that, go to the folder with the game and the "mods" folder will appear there. Just transfer the mods you want to install from my mods folder to your own :D.
4. If you want to install extensions, then go to the folder with the game - assets - mod_overrides. Paste the extensions from my "mod_overrides" folder that you want to install.
5. Enjoy the game!!!
