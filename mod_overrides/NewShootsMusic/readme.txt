Hawk's near complete Sound Pack



Installation Directions: Place/Create a folder in your PAYDAY 2/assets/mod_overrides/Hawks_soundpack/soundbanks, then drop all of the files within this zip file into the soundbanks folder.
To reiterate you need to create 2 folders, whatever sound pack lable that you choose to use then inside of that folder create the soundbanks folder.
Streamed folder also goes into soundbanks folder.

If there are some sounds that you simply do not like, remove them by name, the reload and weapon manipulation sounds however are in one .bnk file so if you do not like them remove the regular_weapon_sfx.bnk file.
